## What is Neurotactics?
Neurotactics is an analytics website for League of Legends, it shows players similar games to ones 
that they have played to help showcase places where they differed to player of higher ranks. This
gives clear insights on choices and decisions where they made a mistake allowing them to improve with
advice similar to what a coach would provide.

## How do I run the frontend?
The front end has been built using react so to run it simply use:
npm install

And then:
npm run start

For the full program to work it requires running the backend API in addition to the frontend.
